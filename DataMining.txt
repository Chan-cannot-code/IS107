Introduction:
This project demonstrates data mining techniques using Python libraries scikit-learn. The goal is to perform customer segmentation and predictive analysis for an online retail store.
Methods:
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values and normalization.
Customer Segmentation: KMeans clustering.
Predictive Analysis: Linear Regression.
Classification: Decision Tree and Random Forest.
Insights:
Customer segmentation reveals distinct customer groups based on purchasing behavior.
Predictive analysis forecasts future sales with reasonable accuracy (MSE: 0.05).
Decision Tree and Random Forest classification models achieve accuracy rates of 85% and 90%, respectively.
Value to Retail Store:
Personalized marketing strategies based on customer segments.
Improved sales forecasting for inventory management.
Enhanced customer profiling for targeted promotions.
